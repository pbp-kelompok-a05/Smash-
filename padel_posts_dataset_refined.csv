Padel Rules - Quick Start Guide - Commentated,GabrielQ1992,"**Intro**: This a simplified version of the rules/uses of padel so people can get playing quickly, I tried to be as clear and concise as possible while not leaving holes in the rules. Any feedback is appreciated. **Equipment Notes:** Padel rackets must be secured by their lanyard at all moments during the play. **How to Play:** The objective in padel is to get points. Points are obtained by: 1. The ball bouncing twice in the opponent's side of the court. 2. The ball bouncing once on the opponent's side of the court and then touching anything outside the opponent's court (i.e., the floor outside the court, the ceiling, a chair, the fence on your side, etc.). Lamp posts that are not used to support the fence are considered not part of the court in this case. 3. The ball bouncing once on the opponent's side of the court and then going beyond the back of the court over the 4-meter fence. If there is no outside play allowed, this also happens whenever the ball exits the court by the sides as well. 4. The opponent commits a fault while the ball was in play. **Faults:** Faults will make the team committing the fault to automatically lose the point, whenever the circumstances. The faults in padel are: 1. The ball bounces on your own side of the court after you hit it. 2. Touching the ball with anything other than the racket (body parts, clothes). This rule applies even if the opponent forced this. 3. Touching the net or the net post with the racket, the body, or clothing. 4. The ball hitting the fence without the ball bouncing in the opponent's court first. 5. The ball hitting the opponent's side walls without the ball bouncing on the opponent's court first. (This does not include the walls on your side of the court). 6. The ball touching anything outside the field before bouncing on your opponent's side of the court. 7. Hitting the ball twice in a row. (Even if the ball bounced on the opponent's side of the court and returned) 8. Touching the ball with the racket for a prolonged time instead of a clean hit. (â€œCarryingâ€ the ball is forbidden) 9. Hitting the ball on the opposing side of the court unless the ball had bounced first on your side of the court during that point. (You can counter a ball your opponent bounced on your back wall hitting it on the other side of the net but you cannot prevent the ball from entering your field in the first place) **Lets:** Some things cause the game to be stopped and the current point to be replayed: 1. A foreign object enters the court. If a foreign object (like a ball from another court) enters the court, the point must be stopped and replayed. 2. A ball or piece clothing falls from a player. In this case, the point must be stopped and replayed. In a competitive setting, any subsequent accidents are considered a fault. **Warming Up** As soon as the players enter the court, it's customary to warm up until all the players agree to start. This usually takes around 5 to 10 minutes. Warmup is performed by playing with the opponent directly in front of you while your partner does the same with the opponent in front of him. The objective of warmup is to achieve consistency, so players should try to make long rallies whenever possible. Warmup usually starts with both players playing balls from the back of the court. Then one of the players climbs to the net and volleys while the opposing player remains in the back defending. When the attacking player is done with the volleys, it's usual to ask for the opponent to throw some lobs to practice overhead shots. Once the overhead shots are done, the attacking players returns to the back of the court and the other players climbs to volley, then to practice overheads. Once all 4 players are ready, the warmup is finished. **Choosing first server**: Before the match, the team that starts serving must be decided. This can be done randomly, by flipping a coin or turning a racket that has a particular marking (usually on the top of the racket or the bottom of the grip). Random choices are often used in competitive settings. In friendly matches, it's customary to play a â€œservice ballâ€ where players play easy shots until each player has touched the ball once and then the team that wins the point starts serving. If the point ends before each player played the ball, the â€œservice ballâ€ is played again. **Scoring:** **Game**: winning a point during a regular game increase the score from 0 to 15, from 15 to 30, from 30 to 40 and from winning a point with a score of 40 wins the game unless the opponent also has the same score. When the score of a game is tied on 40 there are to ways to decide the game: * Traditional, advantages or deuce way: from a 40-40 score (deuce), the team that wins a point gets an advantage (either advantage for the service of advantage for the return). Winning a point while you have an advantage wins the game, losing the point while you have advantage returns the score to 40-40. This essentially means that you must win by a difference of two points. * Golden point: with the golden point rule, when a 40-40 score is reached, the returning team chooses one of their players to return the serve, and the team that wins the point wins the game. **Set**: Sets are won when one of the teams reaches 6 games while the opponent has 4 or less games, when one team reaches 7 games while the other team has 5 games, or, in case the teams reached a 6-6 tie, by winning a tie-break * Tie break: winning a point during a tie break grants a score of 1 during a tie break. The first team that reaches at least 7 points with a difference of 2 with the other team wins. **Match**: Matches are usually played at the best of 3 sets. Sometimes matches that are tied 1 to 1 in sets are decided by super tie breaks. * Super tie break: In occasions, usually due to time constraints, sets might be replaced by super tie breaks. Super tie breaks are identical to tie breaks but the minimum amount of points to win is 10. **Service and return:** Who serves: The team that starts serving decides which player does the first serve. This player will serve until the game is finished. Then, one of the players of the opposing team, decided by them, will serve for the duration of the second game. For the third game, the player of the starting team that didn't serve the first game must serve. For the fourth game, the player that still hasn't served must serve. For the fifth game, it's the turn of the player that served the first game and then the cycle repeats in the same order until the set is finished. Changes to the order of the serving players is not allowed and errors must be corrected as soon as the players realize without changing the score. After a set, the team that didn't serve the last game, or that didn't start the tie-break starts with the service. In a new set, the order of servers and the player's positions for the return can be changed. Serving during a game: The player whose turn is to serve must do the first serve of the game from the right side of the court, directing the serve diagonally to the opponent's right side of the court. After that point, the server executes the server from the left side of the court to the opponent's left side of the court and continues alternating the service sides until the game is over. Serving during a tie break: The player whose turn is to serve for the 6-6 has the first serve of the tie break, which is done on the right side. After this initial serve, and following the serve order of the set, it's the opponent turn to serve, who takes two services, starting from the left side of the court. After that every player takes two services until the tie break (or super tie break) is completed. Technical serve considerations: The player must perform the service from the rectangle delimited by the walls, the serve line, and the imaginary prolongation of the middle court line, in the correct side of the court. The service must be directed diagonally and bounce at least once in the rectangle delimited by the fence, the net, the middle court line and the serve line in the opposing court. If, as it bounces, any part of the ball touches a line, the ball is considered to have bounced on the rectangle. The serve must be executed after bouncing the wall on the floor and hit by the racket at a height not superior to the waist of the player during the serve. The player cannot be running or jumping while doing the service. Faults during serve: A server has two possibilities to perform a valid serve, If his first attempt results in a fault, he can execute another serve without penalty. If this second serve fails, the point is awarded to the opponent. Serve faults: 1. The ball does not bounce on the correct part of the court (ball hits directly the fence or wall, overshoots and lands behind the line, bounces on the incorrect side of the court, etc.) 2. The ball touches the fence after bouncing. 3. The server commits a technical fault during the serve (steps on the line while serving, serves from the wrong side, does not bounce the ball, hits the ball higher than his waist) Serve lets: In these situations, the serve is remade without any penalty to the server 1. The ball touches the net and then proceeds to be a valid serve. 2. The opponent wasn't ready to return the service. 3. A service fault is wrongly called, and the players agree to replay. Reception during service: The players from the team decide which of the receives the first service during the first reception and that player must receive the first service each game until the set is over. This player is not restricted to a place in the court but it's normally situated behind the service box on the right side of the court. Only this player can return the serves executed over that service box. The other player is the only one that can return the services directed to the left side of their court. Technical reception considerations: The serve must be allowed to bounce once before being returned. **Changing sides** The rules stablish that the players must change sides each time the total of games played in the set is an odd number (1,3,5,7, etc.) (e.g., 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 4-1, etc.). During a tie break or super tie break changes are to be done once every 6 points (e.g., 6-0, 5-1, 4-2, 3-3, 6-6, 9-9, etc.). In friendly matches, it's possible to agree to only change sides after each set.",36,0,6
I run a small padel tennis club â€” here's what I wish I knew before starting,Ok-Independence5246,"I've been running a padel tennis club for a couple of years now, and I thought it might be helpful to share what I've learned for anyone curious about the behind-the-scenes side of things, no promotion, just some honest lessons. First off, padel tennis looks like a fun, low-effort business from the outside. It's not. Rent will eat your profits if you're not careful, and maintenance never really ends. Glass panels, turf, lights, something always needs fixing. Second, don't underestimate the community side. Players return not because of perfect facilities, but because of the friendships, matches, and social atmosphere. Hosting casual tournaments or themed nights has been the best way to keep people engaged. Also, if you're budgeting for gear and equipment (nets, uniforms, or practice accessories), you can find some affordable options online, I grabbed a few things from Alibaba that actually held up surprisingly well for club use. Overall, if you're passionate about the sport and willing to learn a bit of business management along the way, running a club can be incredibly fulfilling. Padel tennis is growing fast, and it's amazing to see how it brings people together from all walks of life.",10,0,0

"Love tennis, but seeking more sociable experience - is this the answer?!",Numerous_Mastodon574,"Picked up tennis a couple of years ago and completely fell in love with it. But the biggest problem I have is the community and finding people to play with regularly. In my late 30s based in central London, and even as a club member it's been surprisingly tough and often quite unwelcoming. The only male player under 70 who plays consistently at my club. Most others are retirees or kids with parents hanging around. I joined to meet good people, improve and make some great friends - which hasn't really materialised. I've tried Padel a couple of times and really enjoyed it. It feels far more social, but the court prices are insane compared to tennis, so before I commit I'd love some honest feedback. Is Padel genuinely a more welcoming culture and easier to find partners and form a regular group, or does it end up with the same politics and struggles as tennis? Any experiences and thoughts welcomed!",2,0,2
How to play against tall opponents?,Good_Age3436,"Hello, could you please help with a piece of advise on how to play against tall opponents? Me and my padel partner are around 170-172cm. We are quite short compared to the opponents we play against. Sometimes we have a match against opponents with 210-220cm. It's quite a disadvantage for us as their wingspan is wide and they simply can smash every lob and take any volley. How do we play against such players? We tried different shots, but fail to succeed. Thank you!",11,0,53
"Getting frustrated with my lack of consistency, especially with my backhand",cazza85,"Hi everyone, this group has been extremely encouraging so I come again seeking your wisdom. I started playing last May and since then I went from no padel (with some tennis experience) to playing matches at a 5/5.5 French level (picture, I think ~3.5-4.0 Platomic?). For economic reasons, Playtomic hasn't entered the French market and we often see different Playtomic-like apps in clubs or just a WSP group. So, back to my issue. Against level 5 players, we usually win the matches. 5+ is a challenging match and with level 6 pairs, we are often battling every point. I started group lessons and the coach put me with a solid group of 6/6+ players. It's a bit frustrating to not be able to consistently hit FH/BH against players of this level. I see also how they get frustrated because we can't complete an exercise because of my lack of consistency. Obviously, the more it happens, the more self-conscious I get and I make more and more mistakes. I'm even considering asking for a downgrade to another group. I don't want the other people to deal with my lack of skills when they could work on something more advanced. So, please drop your wisdom on how I can work on my consistency and also on keeping the ball low over the net. And any other recommendations you may have, I'm really feeling stuck. Lots of things that seemed to work well at previous levels don't work anymore (e.g. my serve). I'm also working on high balls (vibora mostly) and finishing shots like flat smash and x3.",7,0,6
Advice on being more active in my stance and game instead of reactive,BerJaa,"So, I have the problem that when playing, I'm just standing there and don't move enough during the point when the ball is in play but isn't my shot, which makes a lot of shots from me reactive instead of actively standing ready. I know this is a problem and am aware of it, but somehow can't find a way to fix this. If there is anyone with any tips or pointers on how to train this during friendly matches or at home, it would be greatly appreciated!",5,0,10
Would there be any reason to not hit a slow (or fast) ball before it hits the fence?,Automatic-Yak-9527,"I always try to hit the ball after glass to slow the game down and give myself more time. I do this with the fence as well, but I feel like I'm losing points by gambling on which direction the ball goes after touching the fence. A lot of time, it makes a sharp turn and falls dead onto the floor. What are the reasons to hit or not hit the ball before the fence?",2,0,4
How to return fast deep serves,Hot-Comfort6783,Quite newish to the game of Padel been playing for 3 months now. Everyone in my group that I play with has been improving every week. My issue is they all have this serve that's fast and low that goes right into the corner of the service box and I can't consistently return the ball on my forehand or backhand side. Even if stand a couple steps back and let it bounce off the glass I still struggle to return it. Any advice on how to return fast serves?,10,0,17
Hard slice shots from the back,LavoP,"I'm playing at the level (early-ish intermediate) where people love to hit these hard slice shots from the back especially if they get a highish ball. Most of the advice I've read says to not focus on hitting like that and instead try to return flat from the back. Sometimes these shots seem to work well, especially if they find a good opening for them. I'm thinking the best way to deal is to make sure I receive these at the net as much as humanly possible. So I guess two questions: what's the best tactic for dealing with players that use this? And is it really just not worth focusing on learning this shot myself?",7,0,29

2 lefties - who should play left?,pannik78,"I know that it's not common to have two lefties in a Padel team but sometimes it can happen either by the club's matchmaking (friendly match) or in an Americano tournament. It has happened to me sometimes and I struggle to find the best tactic on who should play on the left. 1. The best player out of the two so there is a more balanced performance for the team? 2. The weaker player so the one that's better stays in his position and takes more responsibility of covering his partner and biggest part of the court? 3. The more offensive leftie (not all lefties like to smash) plays on the right to have someone who can deal with high lobs in the middle? I always play on the right, intermidiate level, very good on defense and above my average level when it comes Viboras and volleys. Not a big smasher - but OK. I played 2 Americano matches, I was clearly a better player than my 2 partners (and better in offense), both asked me to play on the left... Results were poor. Especially the match with the partner that was significantly weaker than me was a disaster. If I was playing on the right I think we could have done much better.",9,0,22
App / website to find partners,mchantalat,"Hello, There are three padel centers in my town, two on Matchi and one on Sporty plus. These apps are ok to book a padel court but suck at matching players. I heard Playtomic is great but it has to be managed by the padel court owners and they are not using it. Is there any app that can ease the players matching ? I am looking for a doodle like interface where I publish the slot in the week where I am available, my estimated level, and if 3 others players match my criteria we book on Matchi afterwards. Right now I am relying on whatsapp group to find partners and it sucks. Very difficult to synchronize calendar and expected level by messages. And the group lessons of the padel centers are not popular enough to find players. I have the feeling I could play much more but I am a bit stuck by the lack of oppurtunites.",1,0,0

My Padel sessions - Self-taught tennis background.,Odd_Historian2506,"Here's a clip from yesterday's Padel session. I played Padel 5-6 times last season, experimenting with the game to see if I enjoy it or not. I'm coming from a self-taught tennis background. Have hit a Wilson and Adidas paddle which both seemed/felt intro-level paddles. Then, yesterday I played a set with a better Wilson (all-red) paddle that had a much rougher surface and softer feel and teardrop headshape. Much less power than the intro-paddles, but much better ""touch"" and ""feel"".

Why no Lob serve?,Rackelhahn89,"I was wondering why I've never seen a Skylob serve. In volleyball think they call it Superman serve, they punch it high in the air and due to spin and wind it's really hard to receive. In padel easier obviously because they can/must let it bounce. On pro level it would be an invite to smash, I get that, but on amateur level it should be annoying enough. Also, depending on the angle, it could go out over the side fence (x3). I think I've stumbled upon something hereâ€¦",10,0,32

Out of door at serve,Willing-Pineapple937,"Hello, had a Padle match today and we had a discussion if it is legal in a serve to have a short ball, bounce in opponent field and then spin out the door without touching the fence. Is it illegal or legal. On instagram I saw a video where they said it is legal. I can't find anything in FIP though that proves it. What do you say? And where can I find it official? Thank in advance",6,0,13
Illegal Serves Epidemic?,Kommanderson1,"Hi all - I have recently noticed an uptick of players (mostly) from Northern European countries employing illegal methods of serving. These appear to be mostly former tennis players who are relatively new to padel - and are otherwise solid players - but serve in these unorthodox, and technically illegal, ways that seem intended to try and win aces. The rules clearly state that players may not walk, run, or jump during the serve, so I'm not sure where people are getting the idea that backing all the way into the corner and then bouncing the ball while galloping or shuffling into striking it (as hard as they can, or with some crazy underhanded topspin) is legal. I asked one guy if anyone has ever questioned the legality of his serve and he said no, and that he even plays in multiple leagues in his country.. No one likes a rules pedant, but I think we all need to do a better job of policing each other at the recreational level so these tactics don't become normalized. As it stands, it seems a lot of people don't really familiarize themselves with the rules before taking up Padel.",10,0,29
"UK LTA tournament, what playtomic level do you need to be at?",oompaloompagrandma,"So I've been playing for coming up on a year, still obviously building my consistency and understanding, and am presently sitting around a 2.8/2.9 on Playtomic but frequently play with, and hold my own against, guys at 3.5ish. Anyway, my aim for 2026 is to start playing in some LTA tournaments, obviously only grade 5 for now, however it's quite hard to find out what the standard is. For those that have played in, or know more about, the LTA system, roughly what playtomic rating would you say you need to be at to stand a chance of not getting absolutely minced in a Grade 5 tournament? Thanks.",7,0,8
Ball bouncing too high,pep111n,"Hi, I am a low intermediate and yesterday I played a game and realized the ball was bouncing too high mainly when the opponent leave it hit the glass so they have a great opportunity to counter attack.

Serve Receiver partner position,Willing-Pineapple937,I had a match today and so far I always thought the partner from receiver also has to stand behind the line (out of box) at serve. A guy I played with was standing in the field thou. And he said this is possible. The partner can stand where he wants to same as the server partner.

Clarity on hitting above the net,cmc_920,"We all know you cannot reach over and hit the ball over the net (on your opponents side) unless the ball has already bounced on your side. We also know that you can hit the ball on your side and your racket follow through can cross the net (without touching the net). In the second situation when very close to the net, what I am unsure of and wondering if someone knows, is at what point is the ball considered on your side and legal to hit? Does the ball have to be 100% over the imaginary net line before you can hit, or as soon as it crosses this imaginary net line can you strike it i.e. 1% has crossed the line to your side, and 99% is still on the opponents side? I'm sure I read somewhere that as soon as it enters your side of the court you can hit it, meaning the ball does not fully have to cross the net, however I can't find the rule now. Wondering if someone knows or can find it. It makes sense that as long as the contact point is on your side but the ball hasn't fully crossed that it is legal, unless the rule explicitly states the whole ball has to cross. Note: this isn't because of some dispute in a game. It is actually because sometimes I hold back attacking an easy ball because I wait for it to be 'fully' over the net, when really I should just attack it.",2,0,13

Why do padel rackets have holes?,imad_eascart_4177,"Ever wondered why padel rackets are full of holes? * The holes make the racket lighter, so you can swing faster. * They cut through the air more easily which helps with speed and control. * Without holes the racket would feel heavy and hard to handle. * The size and pattern of the holes also change how much power or control you get.

Idea to make serve breaks more frequent without Golden point.,former_farmer,"I've seen some discussions about Padel being too fast, about being ""Padel Wimbledon"" in fast courts, where servers can destroy you with a hard volley or smash right away after serving. Some people ask for Golden point to return. That could work. But I also think of the following. Currently, when you serve you have to have your feet before the line and on your side, but your body and ball impact can be invading the serve line or the other side. This helps you get into place to attack or volley near the net faster. I think if we made a rule that says your whole body and point of impact of the ball should be before the serve lines, and then you can move forward, that would delay the server a bit and cause opportunities for the returner. It's not a huge deal, just a fraction of a second, but it would add some difficulty. The problem of servers having too much advantage was something that was detected already in the early days of Padel and that's why in Argentina it was not valid to volley or smash after a serve. A rule that was changed when the official rules became the european rules, in the 90s. Not allowing you to volley or smash is wrong, but maybe we can do something still without impacting the game that much and that would slow the game down a bit.",6,0,18

Non-dominant hand,epegar,"TLDR: anyone has any tips or experience they want to share about themselves or others they know learning to play with their non dominant hand? Long story: I stopped playing pÃ¡del more than 2 years ago due to an injury. I got surgery, and while my life quality is good and I can do most things with my hand, I can't play pÃ¡del, as that's what triggered the problem before, and when I tried recently I could feel the pain (which I know how builds up game after game). So, after long time considering it, I finally created a new account as a total noob, and joined an event as a lefty. I played at a super low level, I had a lot of trouble with my backhand. I made a couple of double-faults, and I found I could not really direct the ball to specific places, but was just focused on putting the ball in. Overall, I think it was a positive experience, I even managed to win some of the mini-matches. But also, I see there is a long road to get to the point I left it last time.

Very tall players serving high,kYllChain,"Hi there, pretty new to padel here and recently I've played against 2 very tall people (somehing like 2m05) and they both served bouncing the ball very high arguing it was still below their waist. While it was, it gave them the opportunity to make a serve that was not going on a curvy ""low high low"" trajectory but instead ""high low"". They both hit very hard while doing so, the result was that the ball barely bounced (less than 5cm) and I found it quite impossible to return. One of the games was on a wetty court, where it was even worst. Is this an illegal move or is it just because I'm too bad to return this? I tried to search the rules but nothing seems to be covering this. I read somewhere that the serve must be done from ""below"" the ball but I couldn't find it in the official rules.

It becomes SO clear what I have been doing wrong. I actually thought I was good at preparing my shots, but it became apparent that this part of my game is seriously lacking. Preparation was WAY too late on overheads (and overheads are even my strong suit) and I don't bend my knees nearly enough when scrambling in defense (I'm a tall guy so not bending enough is a problem).

Weekend discussion: A trip down memory lane â€“ Padel Trotters,_sebastian,"This might be a short trip down memory lane, since it isn't actually that old, but the other day I was talking about trick shots and when I mentioned the Padel Trotters I was surprised most people had never heard of them. That made me revisit their (now abandoned, I guess) YouTube channel. For newer padel fans, the Padel Trotters were like the padel version of the Harlem Globetrotters. Created by Paquito and Alonso-MartÃ­nez (Peter), they held events where they pulled off trick shots (*trottadas*), had fun matches with several pro players, and involved the public. They also made some cool promos (even LebrÃ³n had some fun https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGX6OqtTgcY). I'll leave some links at the end to their YouTube page for those who have never seen them. I remember having a lot of fun watching their videos, and of course, it was common to see people at the club trying to copy the tricks. I think at the time everyone was trying the shoe kick smash trick from Paquito (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODG\_v3fVA1c). They seemed to have stopped around the Covid period (2021-ish and never returned. Padel wasn't as popular back then, and nowadays it would probably be harder for professional players to balance their time with projects like this. Do you guys still remember them?

We get a lot of criticism from coaches for playing aggressively, on the verge of making mistakes, with lots of smashes and tennis- like shots such as top spins.

The â€œplay it too muchâ€ method that leveled up my padel game,LoneKnight25,"I've been experimenting with a weird little training trick that's been helping me a lot: if there's a shot I *don't* do enough because I'm kind of scared of it, I'll just force myself to overdo it way too much in a match. Like deliberately spam it until it stops being scary. In the end it sort of balances itself out and becomes natural. Example: I used to lob *all the time* from the back. Most of them were bad, short lobs and I'd just get punished for it. The truth was I was low-key afraid of hitting the net if I went for a flatter ball, so I defaulted to â€œsafeâ€ lobs. One day I got sick of it and told myself, â€œscrew it, today I'm only hitting flat balls from the back.â€ That day completely changed how I played. Suddenly I wasn't predictable, and it gave me a new gear I didn't have before. Since then I've been doing this with other shots I avoid. For example, instead of always going middle with volleys, I'll spend a game trying to direct everything to the fence. Or with overheads, instead of always taking the safest option, I'll smash even when it feels â€œtoo much.â€ Same with the bajada. Basically, I dedicate a whole set to exaggerating the thing I usually underuse until it stops feeling foreign. It doesn't mean I'll play like that forever, but it pushes me out of the comfort zone. And when I go back to mixing things up normally, those shots feel way more natural to use at the right time.",68,0,10

Opposing team on playtomic doesn't want to accept the result of the match,AngelisMyNameDudes,"Yesterday I played a competitive match against some randoms which seemed like nice people in the beginning.Their warmup attitude was maybe not the best but no problem. First set: they beat us 6-2. Me and my partner were missing everything. All shots to the net or window. Up till now they were still nice and gave the balls back no problem after a point was over. In between sets I told my partner to not worry, we were just warming up. Second set: They even changed positions on the field... We beat them 6-1. I started playing in the zone. Every volley with heavy spin , every smash deep and heavy, lobs really high and would hit the glass, my leg movement was perfect, I was doing some back hand bajadas that were hard to the middle. Also my partner had unbreakable defense and crazy control. By now they were getting really desperate. They were returning balls after a point by smashing them back. They were complaining a lot to themselves and you could see the light in their eyes fade away. But me and my partner were always respectfull and called every ball correctly. Third set: they switched back to the original positions on the court. Luck was not on their side. The zone also happened on the third set. Complete dominance on our side. We beat them 6-2. In this set their attitude changed a lot. Not a single smile, they would drink water after every game and spend time sitting down. They really seemed like they didn't want to play anymore. I guess they were trying to run the clock out. At the end of the three sets we still had 30 mins of the hour and a half. But instead of playing more when we asked them.One of them got pretty angry at us and started complaining that we were playing to only one of them during the match. This wasn't the case, and even if it was, it's a valid technique to play to the weaker side. I never do it because I find it boring to limit myself to only playing half the court. The point is, these guys seemed on the edge of crying and left even with 30 mins of play time. Now they don't want to accept the real score on playtomic of the match :). They keep cancelling our result and adding an impossible score or simply put 0's for everyone. What can I do? Apart from never playing with these grown men(late 30's) that cry more than babies. Edit: After fighting with the result, me and my teammate sent them messages. Mine was more civil asking if the result was not correct. My partner said they should stop being children and accept that they lost fair and square. They finally accepted the correct result but they blocked us on the app haha.

Where do both players go? * both players move up to cover the bounce OR * right player moves up to cover the bounce and left player covers any baseline drops and side wall smashes to the right OR * vice versa? For reference, I'm a 5.0 tennis player who's loving the transition to Padel but I find myself stuck and confused as to which balls I need to cover for my partner. I'm slowly getting out of the habit of trying to defend as a tennis player and trying to let fast balls hit the back or side wall. I found this previous post super helpful for tennis players but I'm trying to dig deeper into understanding court coverage on defense [https://www.reddit.com/r/padel/comments/1czgo0p/10\_tips\_for\_tennis\_players\_starting\_with\_padel/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\_term=1&amp;utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/padel/comments/1czgo0p/10_tips_for_tennis_players_starting_with_padel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",2,0,6
Has anyone tried the FLOKY NO STRAIN Sleeve for tennis elbow/epicondylitis?,National_Natural7557,"Hi, I've been playing padel for about 1.5 years (2-3 times a week) and recently started playing 6 times a week and hitting more viboras and playing more aggressively and I've started feeling some minor pain in my elbow, likely tennis elbow/epicondylitis. The pain is still manageable, but I want to prevent some major issues. For context, I use a ML10. I'll start doing some preventive exercises I found on YouTube, but **I'm also considering getting the FLOKY NO STRAIN Sleeve to help with support and recovery. Has anyone here tried it? Does it actually help with pain prevention or recovery? Is it worth the investment, or are there better alternatives?** Thanks in advance!",2,0,12

What do you when people can't agree a match score?,aeneasawooga,This is on Playtomic and tbh is a bit pathetic; we played a series of matches where we all rotated partners meaning it was quite hard to keep track. I agreed the scores with two of the other players (as the fourth had left) and posted them. The other player doesn't agree and has changed the result multiple times; I have suggested we just void the result as there isn't consensus but they keep changing the 0-0 result. Is there any way to resolve this or delete the match?,6,0,19

first time playing In Minneapolis- success had a blast,rolopumps,"There is a raquet social club in Minneapolis, that has 3 courts that has been open 2 years, never played before but decided to join a 8 week league. I have experience playing raquet ball, and limited experience playing tennis. Padel is such a fun sport ! I enjoyed it way more than pickle ball. I learned quickly its not really a power game. lot more finese and strategy than i was expecting ! took me about 15 minutes to learn the game. we played for hour. cheers.",0,0,0
Casual video recording setup: Microphone placement?,raytheblue,"I've been recording a couple of matches now with an iPhone outside the court, setup on a tripod. After a couple of videos I felt that I wasn't happy with the sound, since the mic on the phone is outside the glass. It doesn't capture the sound inside the court well. Recently I bought a cheap wireless mic kit that comes with 2 lavalier microphones, the kind you usually clip onto a collar of someone who's talking. I experimented: 1. Clipping them at the top of the net at both ends, on the tape. 2. Clipping them at the middle of the net at both ends, on the netting. 3. Clipping them at the entranceway fence, above our heads when we walk into the court. So far none of the set ups have produced good sound, and there is always a loud crash if the ball hits the net or the fence where the mics are clipped onto. Does anyone have a good casual setup to share? I guess most ideally I would need another tripod outside the court, with an omnidirectional mic pointing into the court. But interested to hear if anyone has success with something simpler.",2,0,12
How to monetize Padel obsession?,Thunderwinter77,"Hey guys, I've been obsessed with Padel for the last 2 years, it's my first real hobby that I truly enjoy and have been consistent with. I think it would be really cool to somehow monetize this hobby that I am passionate about but I'm wondering what's the best way to go about it I think the most obvious option is to open up padel courts (which obviously will be heavy on CAPEX), any advice or considerations on this business endeavor? Are there other ideas to monetize this padel hobby that you'd recommend considering? (I was thinking I can start small with a padel social media account where I can just post gameplay and such, which can later potentially lead to other ideas/ partnerships/ or at least give me a platform to get the word out there about the courts that I might eventually open? Would really appreciate any guidance or inspiration as to how to think or navigate this because I think it would be truly amazing if I am able to make a living while doing something that I love",9,0,68
I am new to padel and I was wondering...,Impossible-Put3165,"Since I started playing padel about eight months ago, I've sometimes wonderedâ€”like in basketball where everyone wants to dunkâ€”what's the â€˜dream skill' or signature move in padel that you'd love to master?

Real Padel struggle,AdministrativeLie194,"Hello everyone I recently ordered BULLPADEL Vertex 04 hybrid 2025, but it's not here yet. I'm having very mixed feelings about it now after reading some comments about this racket.

Started with Babolat Lite, then came Head flash pro and I'm playing now with Bullpadel Vertex 02. So tell me, is the Bullpadel vertex hybrid04 a complete joke or is the a good racket?",0,0,25
Starting a Padel social club at new courts,BitImmediate,"A new padel venue has just opened in my area (5 brand new indoor courts ðŸŽ‰), and I'm planning to start a **padel social club** there. The idea is to make it casual and fun â€” something people can just drop into, open to all ages, with a big focus on the social side (friends, family, maybe the occasional DJ/social event). I'd love to get some advice from anyone who's run or joined something similar: * What makes a social padel club successful? * Best ways to get the first members through the door and keep them coming back? * Should I look at things like WhatsApp groups, ladders, mini-tournaments, socials off-court? * Any tips on branding/naming to make it appealing and stand out? I want it to be laid-back (no membership fees to begin with, just turn up and play), but also something that can grow into a proper community over time. Any suggestions or experiences would be really appreciated",4,0,9

Does a padel ball machine really help improve your game?,inakiei,"Hey everyone, I'm thinking about buying a ball launcher to practice padel, but I'm not sure if it's really worth it. Back when I played a lot of golf, spending hours on the driving range made a huge difference in my game. I'm wondering if padel works the same way â€” can training on your own with a launcher actually improve your skills? I'd love to hear from anyone who has used one: what worked, what didn't, and whether you felt it was a good investment. Thanks in advance!",15,0,34
How do you guys manage your energy before and during matches?,UndeadNordic,"I've been experimenting a bit with what I eat pre-game and what I take during games, but still not sure I've found the best routine. Do you usually load up on carbs before playing, or keep it lighter and focus more on hydration? And during the game itself are you eating bananas/gels, or just water until it's done? Curious to hear what's working for others, especially in long matches or in hot weather.",19,0,36
